            <h4>Why Barcelona?</h4>
            <h3>Barcelona, the city of culture</h3>
            <p>
              Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important
              cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly
              renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís
              Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World
              Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious
              universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu
              Fabra University.
              <br />
              <br />
              The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in
              Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics
              as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition,
              many international sport tournaments have been played here.
              <br />
              <br />
              Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival
              of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the
              dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering
              works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works.
              Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization
              and World Cities Study Group and Network. It has also been part of
              the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since
              2015.
